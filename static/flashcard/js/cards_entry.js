            "question": "Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?",
            "answer": "More than $102. Ignoring interest compounding, borrowing at 20 percent per year would lead to doubling in ve years; someone who knew about\
            interest on interest might have selected a number less than ve.Someone who knows the 'rule of 72'\
            heuristic would know that it would be about 3.6 years, which makes the correct answer '2 to 4 years'.\
            In finance, the rule of 72 is a method for estimating an investment's doubling time. The rule number (i.e., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period to obtain the approximate\
            number of periods(usually years) required for doubling.The other responses reect a misunderstanding of the concept of interest accrual."

            "question": "Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, with the money in this account, would you be able to buy... ",
            "answer": "Less than today. The reason you have less is ination. Ination is the rate at which the price of goods and services rises. If the annual ination rate is 2\
            percent but the savings account only earns 1 percent,\
            the cost of goods and services has outpaced the buying power of the money in\
            the savings account that year.Put another way,\
            your buying power has not kept up with ination."

            "question": "If interest rates rise, what will typically happen to bond prices?",
            "answer": "Fall. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. And when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. This is because as interest rates go up, newer\
            bonds come to market paying higher interest yields than older bonds already in the hands of investors,\
            making the older bonds worthless."

            "question": "A 15-year mortgage typically requires higher monthly payments than a 30-year mortgage, but the total interest paid over the life of the loan will be less.",
            "answer": "True. Assuming the same interest rate for both loans, you will pay less in interest over the life of a 15-year loan than you would with a 30-year loan because\
            you repay the principal at a faster rate.This also explains why the monthly payment\
            for a 15-year loan is higher. Let's say youget a 30-year mortgage at 6 percent on a $150,000 home.\
            You will pay $899 a month in principal and interest charges.\
            Over 30 years, you will pay $173, $757 in interest alone. But a 15-year mortgage at the same rate will cost you less. You will pay $1,266\
            each month but only $77,841 in total interest— nearly $100,000 less."

            "question": "Buying a single company’s stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.",
            "answer": "False. In general, investing in a stock mutual fund is less risky than investing in a single stock because mutual funds oer a way to diversify.\
            Diversication means spreading your risk by spreading your investments. With a single stock,\
            all your eggs are in one basket. If the price falls when you sell,\
            you lose money.With a mutual fund that invests in the stocks of dozens (or even hundreds) of companies,\
            you lower the chances that a price decline for any single stock will impact your\
            return. Diversication generally may result in a more consistent performance in dierent market conditions."
