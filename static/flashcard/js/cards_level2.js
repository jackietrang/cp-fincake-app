            "question": "What are stocks?",
            "answer": "Shares of stock represent equity ownership in a company. When you own shares of stock, you own a small piece of the company. Consider buying stock if you’re looking for growth or to increase your current income.\
            When buying stocks,\
            you should be willing to accept the risk that your investments could decrease in value.\
            Stocks produce income in two ways: Dividend Income and Capital Gains.Dividend Income is a distribution of a company’ s annual profits,\
            typically on a quarterly basis,\
            to shareholders in the form of dividend payments.If you sell the stock\
            for more than your purchase price,\
            you realize a capital gain— the difference between what you paid\
            for the stock and what you received in selling it,\
            less fees and commissions.There are tax consequences * with regard to both Dividend Income and Capital Gains distributions."

            "question": "What are bonds?",
            "answer": "If you're looking to diversify or reduce market-related risk, \
            consider bonds as part of your investment portfolio. Bonds, as part of fixed income securities,\
             are generally considered to be less volatile than stocks. By including bonds as part of your diversified portfolio, \
             you can reduce the effect of market fluctuations and provide a steady source of interest income.\
              When you invest in bonds, you’re essentially loaning money to a government, \
              municipality or corporation in exchange for regular fixed interest payments and repayment of the principal at \
              a specified future date."

            you are actually depositing your money with the issuing institution\
            for a specified period of time. Generally, CDs are issued in maturities ranging from three months to several years.\
            In return, you receive interest payments.At the end of the specified time,\
            your principal is returned to you.Brokered CDs are CDs issued by banks via a“ Master CD” to a nationwide brokerage community\
            for distribution. All CDs have a stated maturity date and interest rate or rates. \
            Because of the variety of features available with brokered certificates of deposit,\
            you can select both the investment period and the rate of\
             return that best suits your income needs. Minimum deposit amounts are usually $10,000,\
            with $1,000 increments thereafter."

            "question": "What is an exchange-traded fund?",
            "answer": "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock does.\
            ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold;this is different from mutual funds,\
            which only trade once a day after the market closes. \
            ETFs can contain all types of investments, including stocks, commodities,\
            or bonds;some offer U.S. - only holdings,\
            while others are international.\

            professionally managed portfolios at a low price.\
            Mutual funds are divided into several kinds of categories,\
            representing the kinds of securities they invest in \
            their investment objectives, and the type of returns they seek.\
            Mutual funds charge annual fees(called expense ratios) and, in some cases, commissions,\
            which can affect their overall returns. The overwhelming majority of money in employer - sponsored retirement plans goes into mutual funds."
